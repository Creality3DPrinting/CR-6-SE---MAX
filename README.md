## Official firmware 

Official firmware downloads can be found on [Creality.com in the 'Downloads' section](https://www.creality.com/download).

**Note:** If you have a CR-6 MAX or CR-6 SE with v4.5.3 board (instead of v4.5.2) you need to have a specific firmware release for your board. The regular releases are _not_ compatible.

## Community firmware

Community firmware, based on a newer version of Marlin, can be found [on the community firmware GitHub page](https://github.com/CR6Community/Marlin#readme). Be sure to read the readme accurately. 

**Note:** Support for the CR-6 MAX and CR-6 SE with v4.5.3 board is present, but you will need to compile the release yourself.
